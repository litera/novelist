# Novelist

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/litera/novelist](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/litera/novelist?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This is a simplified example of a blog-like application built on top of following libraries and technologies:

- **AngularJS** (core, routing, resources and sanitize)
- **Asp.net MVC** and **Asp.net WebAPI**,
- **LESS** syntax styles
- **NPoco micro ORM** for DAL
- **SQL Database**
- **T4** Visual Studio's automated code generation templating

This application does just basic things, but should do those nicely. Don't expect it to be super robust as it's a proof of concept app.

### Things to note

1. Authentication is very rudimentary and completely stateless from server's perspective. Once the user authenticates (via WebAPI call to get user data based on credentials), user info is preserved on the client and accessible through custom AngularJS `securityService` instance.

2. Client-side input validation is implemented using AngularJS

3. Post editor supports extremely rudimentary formatting using regular expressions so it is possible to at least create paragraphs and headings (`h2`..`h6`). It mimicks markdown rules about these.

    * To **create a heading** lines should start with a "#" (1..6 of them), space and heading text and whole line will become a header with level defined by number of # characters at front although `h1` is not allowed in content and will be converted to `h2`;
    * To **create a paragraph**, one should enter an empty line between individual text blocks (double enter); There can be several empty lines and they will still be regarded as a single empty line, so no empty paragraphs should be created;

4. There is no paging in *all posts* view

5. Errors are usually very unspecified in th UI, but in the most important parts, actual erroneous responses from the server are logged into console window, so they can be investigated further

6. Non-trivial Angular assets (controllers, services) are written as **true Javascript prototypes** which may seem unusual, but they provide several benefits in large(r) apps where they can be inherited; Their injections here are manually made available to prototype functions, but this could be automated with a more sophisticated code not shown in this project;

7. API for fetching posts is made available at /api/posts using GET verb and can return JSON or XML depending on request *Accept* header (`application/json` will return JSON data while `application/xml` will return XML)

### Code projects

There are basically **three C# projects** in this solution:

- **Model** which represents defined application model entities (POCOs) and other application-level features
- **Data** which is our DAL that uses T4 to translate database functionality directly to strong typed C# calls used by NPoco micro ORM library, and
- **Web** that is the actual web application including RESTful data API<sup>1</sup>

There is also an **additional *Database* folder** which acts as the fourth project, but is not a formal Visual Studio project. It contains all **database creation scripts** and **automated** batch files that **recreate** (with test data), **restore** or **upgrade** local database directly from within Visual Studio development environment (simply by right-click > Run). This simplifies work with DB without requiring use of additional database tools.

It also helps keeping database scripts versioned while having these things simple and productive.

> <sup>1</sup> API is designed to be completely RESTful but doesn't implement all HTTP verbs apart from those that are used by the web app. But is ready to be extended all the way.

### T4 translation (SPs to C#)

In order to avoid *magic strings/values* when accessing our database via NPoco micro ORM this project utilizes T4 templating engine provided by Visual Studio. This code generator accesses local database stored procedures and translates them to strongly typed C# alternatives, so our back-end code uses only C# code.

This also helps any inconsistencies that may arise during DB development. If one introduces a change in the form of changing SP parameter(s), their order, types or removes an SP (or renames it), there will automatically be a **compile-time** error that our DAL calls don't match stored procedures defined on the database. This prevents runtime errors related to the same.

In order for this to work as expected all stored procedures that should be parsed need to follow this naming convention:
```
Entity_Function
```

Where *Entity* is some application model entity (i.e. *Post*) and *Function* is something that we want to do related to this entity or entity set (i.e. *Create*).
```sql
create procedure Post_Create (
	@Title nvarchar(200),
	@Details nvarchar(max),
	@AuthorId int
)
as
...
```

All these SPs are then translated to *Entity* classes with *Function* methods that use strong type C# parameters semantically matching those of the stored procedure.
```csharp
internal static partial class Post
{
	public static Sql Create(string title, string details, int? authorId)
	{
		// generated implementation
	}
	
	...
}
```
Where `Sql` type is of NPoco library representing a SQL database query.

### Web worker

Web application (or project) also implements a *background* web worker which works autonomously of the web application so it doesn't rely on client web requests. This is accomplished through `HostingEnvironment` object registration and by using `Timer` type that spawns a new thread in app domain. Web application is only responsible of starting it up when it bootstraps itself (on app start).

Web worker executes once every minute and *marks* one of the existing posts as *featured*. Featured post can be observed in the web application as it's always **first** on the list of posts. So if you wait about a minute and refresh *all posts* page it is likely that a new post will be displayed on top position. Due to random selection it may also happen that the same post gets featured twice in a row.
